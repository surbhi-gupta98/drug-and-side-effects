# DRUGS, SIDE EFFECTS AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS

### The intricate relationship between drugs, side effects, and medical conditions, highlighting the complexities of medication management and safety considerations in healthcare.


## Problem Statements
1. Significant lack of Category A medications for pregnant women, highlighting the need for safer alternatives.
2. Challenge of evaluating and categorizing the large number of Category C substances with unclear risks.
3. Lack of clarity about the safety and management of alcohol-containing substances, especially for pregnant women.
4. Need for improved decision support tools for healthcare providers managing patients requiring medications with complex risk profiles.
5. Requirement for enhanced regulatory frameworks to optimize the CSA scheduling system and balance potential abuse with medical utility.

## Tools Used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Tableau

## Conclusions
### Regulatory Framework:
> The system balances both abuse potential and pregnancy safety concerns
> It provides a comprehensive framework for healthcare providers to make informed decisions about medication during pregnancy

### Risk Assessment Complexity:
> There isn't a direct correlation between a drug's abuse potential (CSA schedule) and its pregnancy risk category
> The system acknowledges that some drugs may pose risks but could still be necessary for medical treatment

### The CSA and Alcohol: A Regulatory Disparity

> The CSA selectively targets high-risk alcohol-related substances, not alcohol in general.
> The CSA differentiates between traditional alcohol use and abuse of specific products.
> The CSA uses a tiered control system, focusing on precision targeting.

### Rx_OTC vs alcohol and CSA

> Prescription medications (Rx) make up the largest segment with 945 substances
> Rx/OTC combination represents 292 substances
> Pure OTC medications account for 140 substances

## CSA and its relations with Pregnancy

> Most drugs fall into categories B, C, and D for pregnancy safety
> There's significant distribution across different CSA schedules
> Many drugs have "unknown" classifications, highlighting gaps in research
> Some drugs aren't subject to CSA control (N classification)

## Key Takeaways
The regulatory framework for medications demonstrates a careful balance between ensuring patient safety and providing access to necessary treatments. The system is designed to be adaptable and responsive to evolving scientific knowledge and public health needs.
